### Data Converter tool to translate indian farmer names
This was requirement from government after farmers loan waiver scheme is announced all over india.
This tool used by all rural banks in india to convert english farmer names to 18 indian languages.

### Digital Signage System
This was inhouse project for CDAC.
So idea was to engage viewers nearby in reception area, lobby area with relevant information on screens. and this screens can be feeded with relevant instrctions centrally.
Many important people from government visits CDAC so frequently for various conferences and meetings. so these screen welcomes guests, directs them towords the relevan department/room.
Earlier they used to print out the event specifics and paste it on every noticeboards. be it welcome messages or directiions to conference room. not this is completely replaced with screens of digital signage system.
