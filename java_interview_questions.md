### Explain JDK, JRE and JVM
JVM core engine of JRE responsible to run java program and which uses libraries provided in java runtime. so we can call it as subset of JRE
JRE is resposible to provide runtime environmet while executing java program. it contains JVM and some libraries required by JVM.
JDK is resposible to provide development tools to developer to develop, compile and document. it is superset of all JVM and JRE.

### What is OOPS?
OOPS stands for object oriented programing structure is prgraming pardigm. which adheres to some priciples like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism

### What are OOPS concepts?
abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism these all are oops concepts.

### What is object oriented programing language?
Langugae adhereing to OOPS concepts is object oriented programing language. it means everything we have to do as objects and their behaviour.

### Do you think java is pure object oriented programing language?
No, its not pure object oriented language as it has primitive types which counters the thing that everything is as object in OOPL. But they do have workaround call wrapper class to convert primitive types into the object types.
example: Smalltalk is pure OOPL

### What are all data types in java?
java has data types like short, int, string, boolean, float, long, double, byte.

### Explain OOPS concepts in briefly.
There are four oops concepts as
Abstraction : Abstraction is concept which say to hide implementation details and expose the functionalities. In real life we can map it like, we have bike it has engine which starts with self button, user dont need any impletation details that how that self start button works and how engine fires up. so here presing that selft start button is a functionality part we can say which is exposed by the bike.
programatically abstraction is achivable using abtract class or interfaces.

Encapsulation : Encapsulation is binding datambers and its behaviour together inside class. so we are binding data with code at single place in class. so in capsulation is achived at implentation side.
In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

Inheritance : Aquring properties of some other class into existing class is called as inheritance. in java we have multilevel, multiple in terms of interfaces, hibrid and heirachical inheritance.

Polymorphism : Polymorphism means having multiple forms. So in terms of java we have and interface can have multiple implementations. so it states its polymorphic behaviour.
so there are two types of polymorphism
Static polymorphism: static ploymorphism canbe achived by overloading methods. reloving of methods happens at comple time thats why it is called as static polymorphism.
Dynamic polymorphism: dynamic polymorphis can be achived only by overriding methods of parent class, this reloving of methods happens at runtime that why we call it as runtime or dynamic polymorphism.

### What features itroduced in java 8?
lambda expression in introduced in java 8 to implement functional interface.
stream APIs introduced in java 8 to manipulate data in collections
predicates are also introduced
default and static method in introduced in interface.

### what is difference between abstract class and interface?
before java 8 no implentation was allowed inside an interface but in abstract class we have option from earlier verions.
being class we can only extend one class as multiple inheritance is not supprted for classes in java but we can implemet multiple interfaces.
being class abstract classes do have contructor where interface can not have contructor
Abstract class can contain variables with any access modifiers but in interface only public final static variables are allowed
