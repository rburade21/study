# OOPS Concepts

## Abstraction
Abstraction means using simple things to represent complexity
for example button on TV we cant turn on/off tv by just pushing it without bothering how in works internally.
In java classes, objects, variables represents underlying complex data and code.

## Encapsulation
Encaptulation restricts access to implement security. Creating private feilds in class and providing limited access using other means like getters.
It creates protective barrier to keep data and code safe within class itself.

## Inheritance
Inheritance provides means to create new class having existing properties and attributes of it existing parent class.
It provides reusability in any language

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism is something in which programer provides multiple form to same type of object, method using features like method overloading, overriding.
